# Reference

The project is bases on [this original repository](https://github.com/Rineol/fairness-measures). Our synthetic dataset was generated using the code from there, hence, the generator is not present here.

# The goal

1. be able to choose the right measure of fairness depending on various conditions

2. eventually, answer whether the data is balanced (or how much it is probable to be fair)

# Usage

- After cloning the repository, create a *virtual environment* inside: `python3.11 -m venv venv`

- Don't forget to activate it (depending on your OS) e.g. `source venv/bin/activate`

- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
